An script for auto hspice simulation over inverter chain to find the best combination of fanout/number of inverter with minimum delay.

File List: 
Python files: CADhspice.py (Main file of this project), Proj4_plot.py(file I use in my local environment to plot for graphs)

Text files: result.txt (a raw result obtained as I run hspice), data.txt(a file of my custom print from python, containing the final result)

Spice file: InvChain.sp(The original spice file, in this project I only read it one time and not changing it), InvChainTest.sp (The actual spice file I write and run)
Graph: Project4_graph.pdf
Misc: Makefile

To run the test: put "Makefile", "InvChain.sp", "CADhspice.py" and the library file for cmos under the same directory, and "make all"
